Beans Binding Support for Apache NetBeans Form Editor

This plugin adds back the Beans Binding functionality from NB8.2 to Apache NetBeans version.
This functionality was removed (NETBEANS-172) because of Apache license policy.
The o.jdesktop.beansbinding library used here is licensed GPL and thus can't be distributed together with Apache Netbeans.

So now you can install this plugin and use beans binding again.
